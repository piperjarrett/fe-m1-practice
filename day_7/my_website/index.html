    <p style = "font-family:sans-serif;"> I am passionate about helping others. In college I was the philanthropy chair for my sorirety for a year. I loved creating events to raise money to donate to three different organizations. My sorirty was the second largest donor to Children's Miracle Network, right below walmart. On a smaller scale, I always love helping a friend or family member by picking up lunch for them or doing small favors. Down below is an image from the Children's Miracle Network hospital showing all the donors.</p>
